# Snow-Peridigm

Repository containing the input files for the [Peridigm](https://github.com/peridigm/peridigm/) simulations presented in the manuscript titled "Peridynamic Modeling of the Micro-Mechanical Response of Snow Under High Strain Rates" by Brendan West, Taylor Hodgdon, and Devin Oâ€™Connor. 

Simulation results were presented for three different regions of a snow microstructure, and this repository is split into folders for each region. The input Genesis and YAML files for each region are provided in the different folders.
