# Snow-Peridigm

Repository containing the input Genesis and YAML files for the [Peridigm](https://github.com/peridigm/peridigm/) simulations presented in the manuscript titled "Peridynamic Modeling of the Micro-Mechanical Response of Snow Under High Strain Rates" by Brendan West, Taylor Hodgdon, and Devin Oâ€™Connor.

Simulation results for three different regions of a snow microstructure were presented, and therefore this repository is split into folders for each region. The Genesis files and corresponding YAML files for each region are provided in the different folders.
