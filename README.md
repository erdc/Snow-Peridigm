# Snow-Peridigm

This repository contains the input files for the [Peridigm](https://github.com/peridigm/peridigm/) simulations presented in the manuscript titled "Peridynamic Modeling of the Micro-Mechanical Response of Snow Under High Strain Rates" by Brendan West, Taylor Hodgdon, and Devin Oâ€™Connor. 

Simulation results were presented for three different regions of a snow microstructure. We provide the input Genesis files for each region within a separate folder. An example YAML file is provided for a simulation with strain rate of 0.01 s<sup>-1</sup>. A user can change the strain rate by updating the `Value: "X*t"` line of the `Prescribed Displacement Top` section.
